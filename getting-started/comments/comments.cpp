// Inline comment

/* Multiple line comment*/

// Is good practice to write multiple line comments as follows:

/*
* xxxxxx
* xxxxxx 
*/
// we should add an asterisk on every beginning of a new line

// To avoid problems with nested comments, it is a good idea to comment the code as follows:


// /*
// * everything inside a single-line comment is ignored
// * including nested comment pairs
//  */
